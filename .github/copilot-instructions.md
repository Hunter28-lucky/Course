# Copilot Instructions

- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files unless non-ASCII already present or necessary.
- Avoid reverting user-authored changes unless explicitly asked.
- Treat existing unexpected changes as user edits; ask for guidance before modifying them.
- Prefer built-in tooling and helper functions over manual steps when available.
- Summaries should be concise, friendly, and use markdown formatting tailored for VS Code.
- Provide actionable next steps after significant changes when relevant.
